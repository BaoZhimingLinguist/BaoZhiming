    <main>
     <p>Hi, I am a theoretical linguist working in the Department of English Language and Literature at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I joined NUS in 1993.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>My current research focuses on two main areas: contact linguistics and phonology.</p>
    <p>In contact linguistics, I am interested in how languages acquire new grammatical features from languages they come into contact with, and how social factors influence the development of these features.</p>
    <p>In phonology, I am exploring formal methods for analyzing dialect diffusion.</p>

    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>I teach modules in English linguistics and contact linguistics at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My area of graduate supervision is broader, including Chinese linguistics and theoretical linguistics.</p>
