    *MOE Project*<br>
    <p>- Our main objective is to look for linguistic markers of dementia in natural speech. 
        - We succeeded, and our findings were reported in the paper published in Alzheimer’s and Dementia, which is one of three journals published by the Alzheimer’s Association. It is a major achievement. 
        - For the first time, we discovered significant results based on natural speech data collected from Singaporeans.</p>
